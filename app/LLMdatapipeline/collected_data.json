    "Trail name": "Juan de Fuca Marine Trail",
    "Length": "40.6km",
    "Elevation gain": "1,430m",
    "Estimated time": "12h 10m",
    "Summary": "The Juan de Fuca Marine Trail is a multi-day hike along some of British Columbia’s most pristine and stunning coastal landscape. The route follows the coastline along Vancouver Island, Canada, and takes hikers to numerous grottos, tide pools, beaches, forest, cultural points of interest, and campsites. While most avid backpackers will find this route not too difficult, it is important to say that parts of this long hike are strenuous, especially deep in the middle of the route in Juan de Fuca Provincial Park. Hikers often split this hike into three or four days, depending on experience and passion level, since shorter hikes make for more stops and nature moments. This trail starts to the town of Sooke at the southend, along China Beach at the Parkinson Trailhead and takes folks to the wonderful Botanical Beach close to Port Renfrew. Some people decide to do a return trip to get this scenery in twice, or people can even continue along the West Coast Trail to make the adventure much longer. Once departed the first beach, the trail moves through a few small beaches, thick rainforest, rock/tide pools, and over some nice hills with amazing views of the fauna, flora, and landscape. At a few places along the route, hikers may even have the opportunity to participate in surfing or kayaking, since tour operators do permit backcountry lessons during the summer months. Just be prepared to wait in lines for this, if coming to do those. Along the way, hikers should keep an eye out for wooden signs with orange markings to best follow this route. During the summer months, hikers can also use the West Coast Trail Express to return back to their starting point, if dropping a car off at the end of the trail was not an option."

There are a few spots to watch for roots but for the most part, the trail is relatively flat with a small incline to get to the best part of the falls. For folks requiring wheelchair-accessible areas, the shorter route to the picnic area and washrooms are fitting. \n\nEnjoy the old and second-growth forest full of moss, and the sound of rushing water at the falls. Much of the trail follows the right side of the riverbank since the left side is washed out and not good for hiking.\n\nYou will pass Bannon Falls on the way to the final destination, Rosewall Creek Falls."
